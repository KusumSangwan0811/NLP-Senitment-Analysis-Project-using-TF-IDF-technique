NLP Senitment Analysis Using TF-IDF Technique 
In this project, the aim is to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter text data. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, and neutral) expressed in a piece of text. We will use a dataset in CSV format and employ the TF-IDF vectorization technique and a SVM and Random Forest models for classification.

Outline:
Load the datasets and do Exploratory Data Analysis.
Visualize the datasets and do preprocessing (converting to lower case, tokenizing, stemming etc.).
Implement the TF-IDF Technique on the preprocessed data.
Train ML models including Support Vector Classifier and Random Forest Classifier.
Evaluate the performance of these models and compare their performance.
Choose the model that performs best and dump the model using pickle.
Conclusion.
